# Smart Home System – Design Patterns
This project is a smart home system developed to understand and apply software design patterns.
It focuses on demonstrating how different design patterns can be used in a real-world inspired scenario.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Design Patterns
- Java-Swing

## Design Patterns Implemented
- **Singleton** – Ensures a single instance of the central smart home controller throughout the system.
- **Observer** – Allows smart devices to be notified automatically when system state changes.
- **Strategy** – Enables interchangeable behaviors for different device operations.
- **Template Method** – Defines the skeleton of device operations while allowing subclasses to override specific steps.
- **Factory Method** – Provides a flexible way to create different types of smart devices.
- **Builder** – Separates the construction of complex smart home components from their representation.
- **Adapter** – Allows incompatible device interfaces to work together within the system.
- **Composite** – Treats individual devices and groups of devices uniformly.
- **Decorator** – Dynamically adds additional functionalities to smart devices.
- **Facade** – Provides a simplified interface to interact with complex subsystems.
- **Proxy** – Controls access to smart devices and adds an extra layer of security or functionality.
- **Memento** – Stores and restores the previous states of the system without exposing internal details.

## Project Purpose
The main goal of this project is to practice and understand the use of design patterns
and how they improve code maintainability, flexibility, and scalability.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in a Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
3. Run the main application class.
